# myMalloc 

This project was part of COSC 360 -- Systems Programming at the University of Tennesee. 

It implements a basic version of the C standard library's malloc function using sbrk() to allocate memory from the system. It keeps these chunks of memory on a free list which is coallesced when applicable.
